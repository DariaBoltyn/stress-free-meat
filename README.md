Eco-Tech Solution in factory meat productionю AI and IOT technologies in factory meat production 

Abstract

The whole world is currently going through consequences of a new virus which apparently came from meat, and this is not the first time. A major source of food risks is meat from industrially farmed animals, as major companies lobby their interests and sacrifice safe farming processes as well as animal welfare to keep their costs low.

We believe that the time has come to use technology to improve the safety of meat, to provide transparency to consumers and to make every pack of meat traceable to each production and animal life step. We have prototyped an advanced an eco-system consisting of an ear tag IoT technology recording and controlling the life quality of individual animals, AI mechanisms to reduce animal suffering during the slaughter to improve the quality of meat, a database to collect and analyze the data for improvement of farms’ operations, and a Blockchain technology to make this information available to end customers.

Our product is primarily designed for major farm meat producers to optimize their operations through process analysis, improve the meat safety through quality control at every step, enhance the companies’ reputation and to be prepared for high demand for transparency from governments and society.
